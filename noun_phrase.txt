The thread of fact in this glittering web the reader must pick out
the spinal thread of the incredible romance of that people's career
the immensely distant thread of water
the grim stone house and the blue thread of smoke from Hagar's kitchen chimney.
the bark of a dog and then singing, a thin thread of melody sent aloft by a woman's voice.
