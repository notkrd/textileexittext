which had been the emotional thread of our intellectuals' life
which else would soon have cut the thread of hers, whose sex and qualities demand soft endearment
which were connected only by a like and persistent thread of irrelevancy
which I have likened to a thread of albumen dropped into boiling water
that made them think of the thread of slime left by a wandering snail.
that dwindled to a fine thread of sound, and died
by the needle of our desires
by some thread of philosophy or speculation;
by a thread of skin
by a like and persistent thread of irrelevancy
by one subtle and sure atom, the thread of her life
