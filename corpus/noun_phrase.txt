the spinal thread of the incredible romance of that people's career

the instability of a cylindrical thread of a viscous liquid surrounded by another viscous fluid
The crimson thread of kinship
the motion of a thread of mercury in a glass tube
the email thread
the processor thread
a processor thread in the processor layer
a multithreaded processor
a thread level parallelism
A processor thread load balancing manager
the legends that often embroider the paternity of famous men
