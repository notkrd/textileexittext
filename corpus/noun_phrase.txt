The thread of fact in this glittering web
the spinal thread of the incredible romance of that people's career
the immensely distant thread of water
the grim stone house and the blue thread of smoke
the bark of a dog and then singing, a thin thread of melody
the red thread of a fire on a distant ridge,
the white thread of a gull's flight
the instability of a cylindrical thread of a viscous liquid surrounded by another viscous fluid
The crimson thread of kinship
the motion of a thread of mercury in a glass tube
the email thread
the processor thread
a processor thread in the processor layer
a multithreaded processor
a thread level parallelism
A processor thread load balancing manager
the legends that often embroider the paternity of famous men
a peninsula, although it was anchored to the continent by a long slender thread of land
Factories are divided into textile and non-textile
Textile pattern transfered to pottery through costume
A thread of political speculation
an endeavor of her tender heart
a thread of connection
a sustained thread of sincere sentiment.
amazingly intricate literary compositions, woven from so many strands of text and tradition, 
their pale pink lingerie embroidered with well-known namesodice
the charming playfulness with which she knew how to embroider the most sombre scenes
the thread of the workaday life
the thread of the story
the thread of the complex foreign negotiation
the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds
the ugly seam where doctors sewed up his arm
the scoundrel who sewed up that poor dog's mouth
the three five-hundred-dollar bills now sewed up in the buxom Leah's corset
the railways, textile mills and collective farms of White Russia
the hysteric thread of that woman's sobbing anguish
