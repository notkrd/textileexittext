in and out a cross thread of the web.
in the fabric of Christianity
in a toneless thread of voice.
in picking up the thread of memory.
in a long dark thread of wet across the yellowish wood
in the fabric
in catching the thread of his identity
in the warp and woof of life
in and out a cross thread of the web
in our Tapestry
in the entire thread of human endeavor
in through the weave of the palm fronds
in conclave dark, To weave your treasons.
In the gauze weave
in a weave of complex and conflicting imperatives
